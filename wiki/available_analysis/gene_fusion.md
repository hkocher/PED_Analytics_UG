## Analysis of gene fusion events

This module allows to screen user-defined gene for its fusions with other genes identified across [GENIE](http://www.aacr.org/Research/Research/Pages/aacr-project-genie.aspx#.Wrkpy5PwZ25) samples. The horizontal bars correspond to different biological groups and the colours indicate frequencies of fusions of the queried gene with other genes. The colour key is presented in the top right corner of the figure.
