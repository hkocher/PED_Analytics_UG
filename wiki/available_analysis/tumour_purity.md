Cancer samples frequently contain a small proportion of infiltrating stromal and immune cells that may not only confound the tumour signal in molecular analyses but may also have a role in tumourigenesis and progression. We apply an algorithm that uses gene expression data to calculate stromal score, immune score and estimate score, and infer tumour purity from these values.
