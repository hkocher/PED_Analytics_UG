## Mutation

The mutation module aims at screening selected genes for mutations identified across [TCGA]((https://cancergenome.nih.gov/) and [GENIE](http://www.aacr.org/Research/Research/Pages/aacr-project-genie.aspx#.Wrkpy5PwZ25) samples.
A dedicated visualisation named "Oncoprint" was designed for this purpose. As showed in the picture below, the oncoprint correlates the gene-based and sample-based frequencies of mutation. The grid generated by rows (genes) and columns (samples) are coloured according to the type of mutation. A barplot on the top and right, summarise the mutational frequencies.
Additionally, samples are coloured according to their biological group.

In order to maximise the value of this dataset and promoting a unified environment of analysis between the tools developed by the bioinformatics unit @ BCI, PED takes advantage of [SNPNexus](http://snpnexus.org) for performing the functional annotation of mutations selected by the user according to genomic location, gene of interest and type of substitution.
