Principal component analysis (PCA) reduces the dimensionality of data while retaining most of the variation in the dataset, making it possible to visually assess similarities and differences between samples and determine whether samples can be grouped. This exploratory analysis facilitates identification of the key factors affecting the variability in the mRNA expression data.

For each dataset, scatterplots representing the first two (top) and the first three (bottom) principal components (PCs) of the data are presented. In this instance, the dataset represents collection of pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PDAC) gene expression microarray data, including data from primary tumor, metastatic and normal samples. Each data point represents the orientation of a single sample in the transcriptomic space projected on the PCA, with different colours indicating the biological group to which each sample belongs. The percentage values in brackets on each axis indicate the amount of variance in the data explained by the corresponding PC.
