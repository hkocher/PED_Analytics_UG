This module performs pairwise comparisons of expression profiles between multiple user-defined genes in selected dataset and calculates Pearson's correlation coefficients and p-values for each comparison.

For queried set of genes (at least 2 and up to 50), the portal computes Pearson's correlation coefficients and corresponding p-values for all pairwise combinations of genes and displays the correlation coefficients in a form of pairwise comparison heatmap. The colour of each cell indicates correlation coefficient between corresponding genes labelled on the x-axis and y-axis. The heatmap colour key is displayed on the right-side of the plot with red and blue indicating high and low correlation values, respectively.
