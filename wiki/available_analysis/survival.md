## Survival analysis

From this tab the relationship between the expression of genes of interest (up to 20) and survival can be assessed. For each gene, a univariate Cox proportional hazards (PH) regression is applied to the survival data and the samples are assigned to risk groups based on the median dichotomisation of mRNA expression intensities of the selected gene. Relationships are presented as Kaplan-Meier plots. The hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) from the Cox PH model and associated log-rank p-value are presented in the top right corner of the figure.
